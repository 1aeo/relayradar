README

Files:
parser.php - Used to aggregate statistics across Tor relay descriptor files: https://metrics.torproject.org/collector/recent/relay-descriptors/server-descriptors/

Parser.php - Tor server descriptor files
Works:
Bandwidth Observed Average and Total.
ASN lookup based on IP via 3rd party.
Caching ASN results to reduce repeat lookup calls.
Column sorting on the output tables
Known Issues:
Family fingerprint grouping usually works but sometimes has duplicate groups.
Future plans:
Output summary tables per Family per ASN
Set up parsing per Day as default time period
Add charts
Add detailed server descriptor file parsing

Downloader.php - Download Tor server descriptor files
Future plans:
Upload script with inputs for date range
Add multi threading.
